# ReVolt Car
A simple Arduino-based RC car.

## About
The robot operates in three modes:
1. **Idle:** The robot waits and reacts to surrounding noises, lifting, and touches.
2. **RC:** -> The robot acts as an RC car and can be controlled via Bluetooth.
3. **Follow:** -> The robot uses an HC-SR04 sensor to maintain a fixed distance from a target.

## Project strucure
The project is divided into three parts: hardware, software, and embedded systems.
1. **Hardware**: Circuit diagram (kicad project).
2. **Software**: Controller app (Android/PC flutter app).
3. **Embedded**: Arduino program (platform.io project)
   
## Project Status
The hardware and embedded components are mostly complete.
The controller app is still in progress, but any Bluetooth terminal app can be used to control the robot for now.
